# Machine Learning Nanodegree
# Capstone Project
## Exoplanet-Classifier

The question of the century perhaps, is there another blue dot of life out there in this humungous universe? Are we alone? 
Is there any other ball of mass which could sustain life like our Earth? 

In this project my main focus would be to use the time-series data of flux received by the satellite for pattern recognition and identify the stars with potential exoplanets revolving around them. 

Libraries, Packages and Technology used:
Python3, Pytorch, AWS Sagemaker, Pandas, Numpy, Sci-kitLearn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, SciPy
